Yup, I've reached that point in my life where my blog is no longer hand-rolled but my place
is still near [**that point** on **that chart**](https://rakhim.org/honestly-undefined/19/) where I'm more about the software than about
learning how to write something more substantial than shower thoughts and childish opinions.

Maybe I'll get better at this.
